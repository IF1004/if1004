1-Reading logs from containers

1. First, get log from a linux machine.

$ tail -f /var/log/messages

These logs correspond to events from docker host

2. Now, try running a container as usual:

$ docker run -d --name tomcat -p 8989:8080 tomcat

3. Try follow the logs as they are generated

$ docker container logs -f tomcat
(CTRL+C to break out of following mode).

4. Every request to tomcat will insert a event on tomcat access logfile. To test that, throw 3 requests to container port through curl

$ curl localhost:8989

5. Run bash terminal in iterative mode

$ docker exec -it tomcat bash

6. Read the tomcat access log.

$ tail -f logs/localhost_access_log.<YYYY-MM-DD>.txt

7. Collect the number of sucessfull resquests (HTTP 200)

$ grep "200" logs/localhost_access_log.<YYYY-MM-DD>.txt | wc -l

8. Now, create others 5 containers exposing docker host ports among 8990-8994 (as made in step 2) and put names as tomcatA,tomcatB and etc.

9. Repeat the steps 4 to 7. Remeber to use the right ports on 4th step (ex. curl localhost:8990)

10. Did you like to do those things manually?

11. The last exercise is: show the amount of access on each machine trough
kibana.
