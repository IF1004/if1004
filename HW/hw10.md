# Homework 8
As we´ve seen, we can’t handle with thousands of thousands of docker services manually. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works) can help you to achieve an elevated level of automation in configuration management process.

## Hands on
 A Deployment Pipeline can be built through a variety of tools. As I've done for [Ec2 (AWS Machine) example](https://github.com/jfsc/sonar_aws), create an Ansible playbook to automate the installation of three common dockerized services used in Deployment Pipelines constructions:
  - Jenkins (https://store.docker.com/images/jenkins)
  - Nexus (https://store.docker.com/community/images/sonatype/nexus3)
  - SonarQube (https://store.docker.com/images/sonarqube)

  **Pay attention:** Use the [Ansible best practices](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout) to create your playbook.

  After this exercise you will be able to evolute the playbook to install basic Deployment Pipeline tools.
