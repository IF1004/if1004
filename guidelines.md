# Resources for written reports and oral presentations

## Crediting others

* Proper citations are a hallmark of any solidly written report, and are often useful in other forms of publications. [Citation and Style Guides](http://library.concordia.ca/help/howto/citations.html) (2015) refers to **several style guides**; pick a suitable style and use it consistently. Especially see its section "_**How to cite sources**_".
* For citations, submit a working link to a freely-readable copy if available, and also submit a working link to a URL based on [digital object identifiers (DOIs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) if available. Here is an example citation using [Vancouver system format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_system):
  - Mann ZÁ. [Allocation of virtual machines in cloud data centers — A survey of problem models and optimization algorithms](http://www.cs.bme.hu/~mann/publications/Preprints/Mann_VM_Allocation_Survey.pdf). ACM Comput Surv. 2015;48(1):11. doi:[10.1145/2797211](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2797211).
* The citation's title hyperlinks to a freely-readable resource <http://www.cs.bme.hu/~mann/publications/Preprints/Mann_VM_Allocation_Survey.pdf>. Unfortunately, these versions are often preliminary or ephemeral or both, so it's better to also include a DOI to the final, stable version even if it's not freely readable, as shown in [How to share a link to an article with your students and collaborators](http://library.concordia.ca/services/users/faculty/permanentlinks.php) (2015). The DOI reference in the above citation hyperlinks to <http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2797211>.
* If your publication uses an active format such as PDF or HTML, URLs should be clickable.
* See [Web of Science Journal Title Abbreviations](http://images.webofknowledge.com/WOK46/help/WOS/A_abrvjt.html) for a list of reasonably-standard journal-title abbreviations.

## Written reports

* Simon Peyton Jones's [Research skills](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk.htm) (2015) contains a brief and pleasant section about how to write a good research paper.
* Roy Levin and David D. Redell's [An Evaluation of the Ninth SOSP Submissions –or– How (and How Not) to Write a Good Systems Paper](http://www.usenix.org/events/samples/submit/advice.html) (1983) points out common problems in technical papers, and gives suggestions for how to fix them.
* The UNC Writing Center's [Scientific Reports](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/specific-writing-assignments/scientific-reports) (2012) describes how to write and organize a scientific research report.
* David A. McMurrey's [Online Technical Writing](http://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/) (2013) contains many examples and much discussion of technical writing. For example, it has a [chapter on recommendation and feasibility reports](http://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/feas.html) that contains several sample reports.
* George Gopen and Judith Swan's [The Science of Scientific Writing](http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/num2/the-science-of-scientific-writing/1) (1990) briefly summarizes some of the science behind writing clear writing for scientific audiences.
* William Strunk, Jr.'s [The Elements of Style](http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html) (1918) is the classic style guide for American English writing. It excels at showing [how to omit needless words](http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style3.html#13).
* The [USENIX Templates for Conference Papers](https://www.usenix.org/templates-conference-papers) provides [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) and [DOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_%28computing%29) templates for computer science research papers. The USENIX templates use a two-column format with 10-point font for most of the text, on an 8½"×11" page. LaTeX typically generates higher-quality output for technical papers. An [example of the output format](http://www.usenix.org/events/samples/frame.pdf) and an [example student paper](http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa05/tech/golubitsky/golubitsky.pdf) are available.
* The Cabrillo Tidepool Study's [Scientific Report Rubric](https://academics.utep.edu/Portals/1559/docs/resources/2007Seminars/Scientific%20Report%20RubricCabrillo-TidepoolStudy.pdf) (1997) is the sort of thing we use when evaluating your report.

## Oral presentations

* Simon Peyton Jones's [Research skills](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk.htm) (2015) has a section "How to give a good research talk" almost makes it look easy and covers the essentials. He's brave enough to point you to a video of himself, giving the talk.
* Michael Ernst's [Giving a technical presentation (giving a scientific talk)](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/advice/giving-talk.html) (2014) contains workable and up-to-date advice for giving computer science talks.
* Mark D. Hill's [Oral Presentation Advice](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~markhill/conference-talk.html) (1997) briefly describes how to give a good talk. It contains a summary of David Patterson's classic [How to Give a Bad Talk](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~markhill/conference-talk.html#badtalk) (1983).
* Judith P. Rhodes et al.'s [Scientifically Speaking: Tips for Preparing Scientific Talks and Using Visual Aids](http://www.tos.org/pdfs/sci_speaking.pdf) (2005) contains advice and observations on preparing and delivering a scientific talk. Its advice on poster presentations is also valuable, though you can skip it if you are not making a poster.
* The [Science and Engineering Library](http://www2.library.ucla.edu/libraries/sel/) (SEL) has a learning center with equipment with which you can rehearse your presentation. Reserve a time slot by visiting the circulation desk in Boelter 8270.
* Caroline McCullen's [Student Presentation Rubric](http://www.ncsu.edu/midlink/rub.pres.html) (1997) is the sort of thing we use when evaluating your presentation.
